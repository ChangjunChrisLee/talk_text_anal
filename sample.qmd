## Research Background

<br>

### Metaverse

-   Definition

    -   A virtual coexistence world that combines online virtual space and
        reality

    -   A compound word of `meta` meaning transcendence and `universe`
        meaning universe

    -   A collective virtual world of coexistence in which `virtual space`
        and `physical space` are combined (**virtual shared space**)

> the metaverse is a combination of virtual worlds, augmented reality, and
> the internet. The common devices that let you access this virtual space
> include augmented reality (AR) glasses and virtual reality (VR) headsets.

### Metaverse

## Research Background

<br>

### Metaverse is different from the existing SNS

<br>

-   Unlike existing SNS, the metabus environment has a difference in that

    -   `social exchanges` and

    -   `cultural and economic activities` are possible.

<br>

-   In addition, users can exist in various forms:

    -   From what you can see in MV (Appearance, Clothing Style, Brand)

    -   Even to the invisible things (Personality, Characteristics)

<br>

> All these features become real with **Avatar**.

## Research Background

<br>

### Multi-persona

> `Multi-persona` refers to the concept of an individual assuming multiple
> roles, identities, or personas, often to adapt to different contexts or
> environments, or to fulfill various needs or expectations.

-   Contexts:

    -   Personal life (family, friends, hobbies)
    -   Professional life (work, career, networking)
    -   Online presence (social media, forums, gaming)
    -   Cultural or social settings (community, religion, politics)

## Research Background

<br>

### Multi-persona

> `Multi-persona` refers to the concept of an individual assuming multiple
> roles, identities, or personas, often to adapt to different contexts or
> environments, or to fulfill various needs or expectations.

-   Reasons for adopting multi-persona:

    -   Adaptability and versatility
    -   Privacy and anonymity
    -   Personal exploration and growth
    -   Meeting diverse expectations or demands
    -   Creativity and self-expression

## Research Background

<br>

### Multi-persona

> `Multi-persona` refers to the concept of an individual assuming multiple
> roles, identities, or personas, often to adapt to different contexts or
> environments, or to fulfill various needs or expectations.

-   Benefits:

    -   Enhanced flexibility and adaptability
    -   Improved understanding of different perspectives
    -   Greater personal and professional growth
    -   Ability to navigate various social situations
    -   Increased resilience and coping strategies## Research Background

### The Effects of Metaverse Users' Social and Psychological Factors on Avatar Customization

> Here, Multi-persona is the degree to which an avatar is created
> differently from the actual person (Appearance, Brand, Style,
> Personality). (Lee et al., *working paper*)

![](img/study_1_result.png){fig-align="center"}

## Problem Description

![](img/meta_diagram.png)

-   Explored the factors of boosting users' Multi-persona tendency

-   However, still unknown mechanisms remain (i.e. **Multi-persona** →
    **Attitude**, **Flow**, **ITU**)

## Research Questions

<br>

<br>

1.  Do users' multi-persona tendencies differ between metaverses based on
    anonymity and real name?
    -   between Real vs. Meta (Real-name based)
    -   between Real vs. Meta (Anonymous)
    -   between Meta (Real-name based) vs. Meta (Anonymous)

<br>

2.  How do multi-persona tendencies affect the way enjoying metaverse?

    -   What is the relationship between multiple personas and attitude to metaverse?
    
    -   What is the relationship between multiple personas and immersion?

    -   What is the relationship between multiple personas and intention to
        use?

## Method

## Discussion

<br>

#### What we've found are..

<br>



1.  Do users' multi-persona tendencies differ between metaverses based on
    anonymity and real name?
    
    -   between Real vs. Meta (Real-name based)
    
    -   between Real vs. Meta (Anonymous)
    
    -   between Meta (Real-name based) vs. Meta (Anonymous)

<br>
<br>

### **Answer: Indeed!**

## Discussion

<br>

#### 2.  How do multi-persona tendencies affect the way enjoying metaverse?
<br>

-   **Multi-persona** in `avatar appearance` is associated with a positive
    attitude towards the metaverse and increased likelihood of continued
    usage, regardless of the type of metaverse (Exp 1, 2, and 3).

-   **Multi-persona** in `avatar style`: A more casual style is associated
    with a lower likelihood of continued usage in anonymous metaverses (Exp
    1).

-   **Multi-persona** in `avatar brand`: No-brand is more associated with a
    high immersion in both real-name based and anonymous metaverse (Exp 2
    and 3).

-   **Multi-persona** in `avatar characteristics`: Multi-dimensional avatar
    character is associated with a positive attitude and high immersion
    (Exp 2 and 3).

> *The tendency to create multi-personal avatars is shown to have an impact
> on attitudes, immersion, and intention to continue using the meta-verse
> platform!*

    

    
## Future Plans

<br>

-   Robustness check

<br>

-   Explore more.. 

    -   e.g.) Multi-perosonal tendency clustering
    
    -   Explore any difference in metaverse usage among clusters
    
    
<br>


-   Wrapping up the results and find a target journal
